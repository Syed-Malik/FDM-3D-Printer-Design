# Cost-Effective FDM 3D Printer

## Overview
This project involved the design and fabrication of a functional FDM 3D printer optimized for academic and industrial usage. The focus was to minimize production costs while maintaining high reliability and print quality.

## Key Contributions
- Designed mechanical components using SolidWorks and fabricated the frame with sheet metal.
- Optimized printer head calibration and temperature control systems.
- Integrated custom-built extruder and drive system.
- Reduced production cost by 15% compared to commercial systems.

## Skills & Tools
SolidWorks | Fabrication | Rapid Prototyping | Manufacturing | Cost Optimization

## Outcome
Delivered a fully operational printer used in lab applications and student workshops.
